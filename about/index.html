      <p>My name is Sacha Schmid. I'm a front-end developer from Switzerland, interested in both interface design and web development. I work at <a href="http://schwabe.ch">Schwabe</a> in Muttenz, Switzerland.</p>

    <p>Currently, I am studying Computer Science at the <a href="http://fhnw.ch/en/">University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland</a> in Brugg, Switzerland and am on track to get my bachelor's degree in 2017.</p>
    <p>I have previously had experience in front-end development while working with private clients, small companies, and a large Swiss department store, as well as a multitude of projects at university. You can see some of that work on my <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page. Clients enjoy working with me because I am a disciplined worker who likes to bring his own ideas into the project at hand.</p>

    <p>A keen interest in technology allows me to stay on top of the ever-evolving world of design and development. This way, my websites and applications use modern techniques, follow current and classical design trends, and achieve a pleasant user-experience. I have created websites and applications using a multitude of languages and tools.</p>

    <p>Of course I am not always just sitting on the computer. I am very passionate about music, both consuming my favourite songs and creating music with my guitar. Whenever I can, I like to go to concerts and festivals and just enjoy the music and the people around me. Quite recently, I've also taken an interest in <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/saywhoa">collecting vinyl</a>.</p>
    <p>Other than that, I like to watch TV shows or spend time at the cinema. Weather permitting, you might also find me on my bike or inline-skating all around Switzerland.</p>
