For the last couple of months I have know that I'd needed to work on my website. The last update was somewhere in mid-2012 with nothing happening ever since. That certainly needed to change. I wanted to be able to push updates more frequently and to have a more dynamic represantation of my work around the web.

# What to expect here

I plan on writing about HTML, CSS, JS and maybe, some day, even some Ruby. Overall you could say my main focus lies on all things front-end-related. I have prepared some posts I'll publish over the next couple of days, as well as some quick drafts.

At the moment I don't think I'll do any link-list style posts. I share most of the interesting things I discover [on my Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:sachaschmid "sachaschmid on Pinboard") so that's where you'll find such links.

# Technical stuff

In order to make things more dynamic I've decided to start using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Official Jekyll documentation") to build the entire site. After a quick learning curve, things got more and more interesting with every new [Liquid filter](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics "Liquid basics by Shopify") I discovered; Jekyll and its friends form a very broad world with lots of things to learn and play with. I ended up settling for a pretty simple site, with more things coming in the near future.

Along with moving to Jekyll I ditched my old FTP workflow for [gh-pages](http://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages overview by GitHub"). It was incredibly easy to set up and I am looking forward to improve my workflows even more.

The next step is to combine Jekyll with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/ "Official Grunt.js documentation") to process Sass files, combine JS files and other things. I have used Grunt in various ways on other projects before, but combining it with Jekyll is not yet very clear to me. If anyone has some quick tips on this, I'd be glad to hear them.
